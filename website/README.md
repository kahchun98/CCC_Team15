# Node based front end
This is a node.js based front-end website for CCC Assignment 2 Team 15

## Getting Started
First run command at the root directory.
'''
npm install
'''

Then run command:
'''
npm run dev
'''
which will start up the front-end

Nodemon is setup so you don't have to re-run the front-end whenever you make changes.
Just simply refresh the page and changes should be reflected.
